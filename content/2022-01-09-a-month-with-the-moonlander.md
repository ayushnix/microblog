I'm happy to report that I don't regret buying the Moonlander. Although I haven't regained my
original typing speed (still at ~40-60 WPM), I'm able to type with much more comfort than a typical
keyboard. I can confidently say that I won't use a typical keyboard as my primary keyboard ever
again. I'm also glad that I got the Kailh Box White keycaps. I really like how they require lesser
actuation force but are clicky at the same time. I no longer feel pain in my fingers after long
typing sessions but I also don't lose the tactile and clicky response that I love.

Was the transition painful? Yes. However, it was worth it.

However, I don't think that the Moonlander is a perfect keyboard. The thumb clusters are poorly
designed and aren't ergonomic at all. You have to deliberately move your fingers to press keys on
the thumb clusters. The irrational obsession with RGB backlighting is also a turn off although this
issue is quite pervasive among pre-built mechanical keyboards. I also ordered MT3 /dev/tty keycaps
from Drop because they seem preferable to type on than the uniform OEM row 3 keycap profile that the
Moonlander comes with by default. I'm not using a laptop keyboard and I don't intend to switch to
Colemak DH or Workman anytime soon so I don't really need uniform keycaps.

I hope the Moonlander lasts for a long time and turns out to be worthy investment.
