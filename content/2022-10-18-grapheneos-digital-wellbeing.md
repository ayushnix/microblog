Of all the things that could've made using [GrapheneOS][1] a deal breaker for me, I didn't expect
that the absence of [Digital Wellbeing][2] would be it. Unsurprisingly, it isn't a part of <abbr
title="Android Open Source Project">AOSP</abbr> (Android Open Source Project) and [GrapheneOS has
refused][3] to add it. I tried installing the <abbr title="Android Package">APK</abbr> (Android
Package) file of this app but that didn't really work as expected.

I know it's kinda ironic that the absence of a digital wellness app made by Google would make me
switch back to the stock Pixel ROM but this app helped me become less interested in my smartphone
and enabled me to focus on my work without being interrupted. I used the Focus Mode feature to pause
most apps and turn off all notifications at a specified time. I also used the Focus Mode quick tile
to turn it on at unscheduled times. When Focus Mode was on, the opacity of the paused app icons was
also lowered. I could also temporarily turn off Focus Mode when I took a short break and then turn
it back on. Unfortunately, since I've installed GrapheneOS, I haven't been able to focus on my work
or be productive during my work sessions.

I tried using the Do Not Disturb Schedules, ActionDash, and a few other alternatives but none of
them do what I want. No, I don't want to use Do Not Disturb for this. I still want to receive calls
but no notifications. I don't want to change the Do Not Disturb settings every time to simulate
Focus Mode and the actual Do Not Disturb Mode. It's a pity that I have to go back because one of the
things I really liked about GrapheneOS was the ability to restrict network access in apps.
