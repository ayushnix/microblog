A lot has happened since I wrote a microblog post. I moved back to GrapheneOS
after missing the feature to disable network access from applications on
Android. I was using a Pixel 4a and although it's a great phone, its
performance wasn't really great and its battery life took a turn for the worse
after several years of usage. I became increasingly frustrated by the lack of
small form factor smartphones on the market and in a moment of temptation and
annoyance, I went ahead and bought a 3rd generation iPhone SE.

To be fair, it's a decent phone and I really like

- how it has significantly better applications for Mastodon than Android
- integrates calls from Signal and WhatsApp in the native dialer app
- it's small form factor; it's a pleasure to hold this device

Unfortunately, and unsurprisingly, I didn't end up liking how iOS is a closed
walled garden ecosystem. I can't use Firefox with uBlock Origin, apps like
NewPipe and Tachiyomi, and can't turn off network access from apps.

I'll probably buy a Pixel 8 and move back to GrapheneOS in a few months.
