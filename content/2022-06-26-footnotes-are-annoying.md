I've always found footnotes in blogs and wikis to be annoying but I wasn't aware of a better
alternative. I discovered [Chris Morgan's blog][1] several months ago and the first thing that I
really liked about his website were sidenotes instead of footnotes. Instead of jumping to the end of
the page by clicking a link and then jumping back (approximately) to where you were before,
sidenotes are simply present either on the left or right side of the body text. You don't need to
click anywhere, you don't need to adjust to the disorienting page jumps, you can read the sidenote
and carry on.

I'm working on creating my own blog and my own wiki using the [Zola static site generator][2]. A
microblog doesn't need sidenotes but a blog and a wiki does. If you're interested in using sidenotes
on your website instead of footnotes, there's an extremely helpful blog post by Gwern Branwen called
[Sidenotes In Web Design][3].
