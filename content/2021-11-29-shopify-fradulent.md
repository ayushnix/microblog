I ordered a [ZSA Moonlander][1] on 2021-11-28. I assumed everything would go well but ZSA informed
me the next day that my order has been cancelled because Shopify flagged my order as "high-risk".
ZSA gave me [this link][2] which lists the parameters that Shopify uses to judge if an order is
fradulent. This includes

- whether my billing address is the same as the registered address on my credit card
- whether my billing address ZIP code matches what's registered on my credit card

I guess people don't live on rent and change addresses after a few years. If they do, surely they
always remember to change their registered address on their credit card.

The most ridiculous criteria, which probably got my order flagged, seems to be

- shipping address is 520km from the location of my IP address

My ISP has assigned me an IP address with a location that's more than a thousand kilometers from my
actual location. I guess I can't order anything from merchants that use Shopify if I use my
broadband connection.
