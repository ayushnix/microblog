After several weeks of learning HTML and CSS, I've finally published my first frontend project, the
[kangae microblog theme][1] for the zola static site generator. I'm not a web developer and I don't
intend to be one either. However, I really wanted to learn HTML and CSS and create my own blog and
websites. Plus, I also learned how to use jinja templates (technically, tera templates although
they're pretty similar).

Go ahead and use kangae to create your own microblog website. Optionally, raise a pull-request in
the [kangae git repository][1] if you want to showcase your own website.
