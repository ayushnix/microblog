It's interesting to notice that some people actually argue in favor of web browser engine
monoculture on a [certain popular forum][3]. The arguments in favor were that a web browser
monoculture favors "rapid innovation" and introduction of "actual features" rather than "wasting
time on interop".

Is "rapid innovation" worth it if people have no privacy while they browse the web? Is it worth it
if we're bombarded by targeted advertising and tracked by a feature that's actually called ["Privacy
Sandbox"][4]? It doesn't just waste time and data which, believe it or not, is still a precious
resource for many people, it also damages people psychologically. The days of efficient and
effective ad blocking [are numbered in Chrome][1] and many other Chromium derived web browsers and
for those who don't like this scenario, there's Firefox. But hey, I guess some people care more
about "rapid innovation" than mental peace and sanity while browsing the modern web.

I guess I empathize with people who're creating protocols like [Gemini][2] to try and create a niche
for themselves in the face of this authoritarian centralization.
