I tried switching to Colemak-DH but it turns out that it's too painful to
discard decades of muscle memory. I went from 80 words per minute to less than
10 words per minute for 2 days after switching to Colemak-DH. I'm not sure if
you've ever experienced something like this but it feels as if your hands have
suffered partial paralysis. The last time something like this happened to me
was when I switched from a traditional staggered keyboard to my
[Moonlander][1], an ortholinear split ergonomic keyboard. I went from
approximately 100 words per minute to less than 15 for almost a week. Why did I
do it? Mostly because I wanted a more comfortable typing experience and I'd say
that I was successful in seeking that from my Moonlander.

After switching to Colemak-DH, I didn't really like the new positions of the H,
J, K, and L keys because I've used vi, vim, and neovim for almost a decade now
and the relocation of these keys made life ... extremely difficult, to say the
least. I use the same keys for navigation on [sway][2] and my [terminal file manager,
lf][3].

There's lots of content on YouTube about how alternative keyboard layouts are a
godsend and how outdated and inefficient QWERTY is. One of the videos that
stands out to me is from the channel JellyOsaurus titled "[Do Not Switch to
Colemak (from a Colemak User)][4]".

Do I still plan on switching away from QWERTY? Perhaps. In the short time that
I used Colemak-DH, I realized that it would definitely be a more comfortable
typing experience, assuming I could have the same typing speed (approximately
80 words per minute) that I have right now. I guess it'd be easier to start
using Colemak-DH rather than QWERTY as a kid but in any other case, the
transition will definitely be painful. The issue of using neovim keybindings
still remains though. I'll need to either find out or design a custom keyboard
layout that retains the neovim navigation keys and changes as few keys as
possible. I guess I'll start with moving just a single key and gradually change
other keys as well. This idea comes from the Minimak keyboard layout.
