I know, it's been too long since I made a post on this microblog. I won't say
I'm not at fault but there were a few reasons why I stopped posting.

First, I have become increasingly [disenchanted with using Markdown][1] (and its
various incompatible dialects) as my primary mode of documentation. I know the
treesitter parser I was using in neovim at the time has probably been improved
now but for better or worse, I'm no longer interested in writing Markdown. This
makes the theme this microblog uses, [kangae][2], an abandoned project which
will not be developed anymore.

Second, I became interested in the idea of moving my (infrequent) microblog
posts [to the Fediverse][7] and I started interacting with people on it.
However, I noticed that my replies often get ignored by some people. I'm not
sure what's wrong and I no longer care to ask. I'm not the kind of person who
would troll others or talk in bad faith. I realized that writing posts on my own
website, something which I own, is still important and sometimes better, even if
no one reads it. This is one of the reasons I started posting (infrequently) on
[my gemini website][6]. I plan to make both HTTP and gemini versions of my
website in the near future.

Third, I have been working on some personal workflow optimizations which aren't
worth talking about unless they're finished but many of them aren't. For
example, after successfully building my ZFS NAS on my desktop, I decided to
organize my music library containing mostly FLACs using the software [beets][3].
However, using beets turned out to be an **infuriating** experience to the point
that I started questioning myself about what the hell I've been doing since the
past 5 years. Why can't I fix obvious flaws and issues when I encounter them in
projects, flaws that other people seemingly don't give a shit about? Why do
these flaws become showstoppers and productivity killers? Why can't I simply go
into full <abbr title="Not Invented Here">NIH</abbr> mode and make something of
my own rather than expecting others to do something for me?

I've decided that I've had enough of becoming frustrated whenever I encounter
these roadblocks. I've started teaching myself how to write code and I've begun
with the book [Simply Scheme by Brian Harvey and Matthew Wright][4]. I'll follow
it up with [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][5]. I know, it'll
take some time for me to become compentent enough but I'm patient and can put
stuff on hold until I can do it right. And I won't quit this time.

Thank you beets, for making me frustrated enough to question myself and for
making me go down this path.
