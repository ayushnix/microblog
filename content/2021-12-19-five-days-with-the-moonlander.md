I got tired of using my shitty Redragon K561 mechanical keyboard. It doesn't have hotswappable
switches and some of its switches don't generate any sort of feedback or click anymore. I bought the
K561 back in 2017.

I've been looking for a high quality ready-to-use 65% replacement but couldn't find anything easily
obtainable and worth buying. For some reason, I decided to go ahead and buy a [ZSA Moonlander][1].
After losing $30 dollars because ZSA and Shopify decided to flag me as suspicious, I spent
approximately $480 ($365 for the keyboard, $115 went to thieves in New Delhi and I was told that I
was lucky they didn't get more) to get the Moonlander delivered on 14th December.

Although the improvement in my body posture, especially my back, has been noticeable, my typing
speed reduced from around 80-90 wpm to 15-20 on the first day. This is the 5th day and I've barely
crossed more than 40 wpm.

I hope I don't regret spending all that money on the Moonlander.
